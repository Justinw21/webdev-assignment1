            <h1>Gorilla</h1>
            <p>
                Gorillas are the largest living primates, native to the forests of central Sub-Saharan Africa. 
                These highly intelligent animals are divided into two species: the eastern gorilla and the western 
                gorilla, each with further subspecies. Known for their muscular build and impressive strength, 
                gorillas are primarily herbivorous, feeding on leaves, fruit, and shoots. They live in tight-knit 
                family groups called troops, led by a dominant male known as a silverback, named for the distinctive
                 silver hair that develops on their back as they age. Gorillas are gentle and social animals, communicating 
                 through a range of vocalizations, gestures, and facial expressions. Despite their peaceful nature, 
                 they are capable of defending their group if threatened. As critically endangered species, gorillas 
                 face significant threats from habitat destruction and poaching, and ongoing conservation efforts are
                  vital for their survival.
