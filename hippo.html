            <h1>Hippo</h1>
            <p>
                Hippos, or hippopotamuses, are large, semi-aquatic mammals native to sub-Saharan Africa. 
                Known for their massive size, hippos are among the heaviest land animals, with males weighing 
                up to 3,200 kilograms (7,000 pounds). Despite their bulky appearance, hippos are surprisingly 
                agile and can run at speeds up to 30 kilometers per hour (19 miles per hour) on land. They spend 
                most of their time submerged in rivers and lakes to keep cool, emerging at night to graze on grass.
                Hippos are known for their powerful jaws and large tusk-like teeth, which they use for defense. 
                Although they have a peaceful appearance, hippos are highly territorial and can be very aggressive 
                when provoked. As a keystone species in their ecosystems, hippos play a crucial role in maintaining 
                aquatic habitats, making them essential to Africaâ€™s biodiversity.
